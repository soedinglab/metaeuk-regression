there are two proteins, one with 385 amino acids and one with 245 amino acids (identical to the first 245 amino acids of the other protein).
the contig only codes for the short one so if we require a target coverage of at least 0.65, we should get only a single MetaEuk prediction (matching thee shorter one)
